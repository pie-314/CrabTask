# CrabTask

**CrabTask** is a modern, terminal-based task management application written in Rust. It leverages a TUI (Terminal User Interface) to provide a robust, interactive, and visually appealing way to manage your daily to-dos, with features such as calendar navigation, task highlighting, and progress trackingâ€”all from your terminal.

---

## Features

- **Task Management**: Add, list, and manage your daily tasks, organized by date.
- **Interactive TUI**: Built with [ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui), offering a smooth and keyboard-navigable interface.
- **Calendar Integration**: See your current month's calendar, with today highlighted.
- **Persistent Storage**: All tasks are stored in a local JSON file (`data/todo_data.json`), ensuring your data persists across sessions.
- **Task Details**: Each task can have a title, due date, priority, notes, and completion status.
- **Keyboard Controls**: Navigate tasks, mark them complete, add new tasks, and more using simple key bindings.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (edition 2021 or later)
- A terminal emulator that supports UTF-8 and ANSI colors

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/pie-314/CrabTask.git
   cd CrabTask
   ```

2. **Build the project**
   ```sh
   cargo build --release
   ```

3. **Run the application**
   ```sh
   cargo run
   ```

   On first run, a `data/todo_data.json` file will be created if it does not exist.

## Usage

Once running, CrabTask presents a TUI with your daily tasks and a calendar view.

### Key Bindings

| Key         | Action                         |
|-------------|-------------------------------|
| Up/Down     | Navigate tasks                 |
| `a`         | Add a new task (TUI/legacy)   |
| `d`         | Delete selected task           |
| `m`         | Mark task as complete          |
| `q` or `Q`  | Quit application              |

> *Note: Some keyboard shortcuts may be available only in the legacy interface.*

### Task Data Format

Tasks are stored in a JSON file, each as a `Todo` object:
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "title": "Buy groceries",
  "completed": false,
  "due_date": "2025-08-20",
  "priority": "high",
  "notes": "Buy milk, eggs, bread"
}
```
